Quantum Interpretation License

Uncontracting™ - Where Interaction Becomes Interpretation

Copyright (c) 2024 Spectral Navigator Project

Permission is hereby granted to interact with this work in ways that transform
perception and understanding. This license recognizes that interpretation is 
a dynamic, quantum-like process where the act of observation fundamentally 
alters the observed.

Key Principles:
1. Interaction is interpretation
2. Perspectives are probabilistic, not absolute
3. The observer is an integral part of the system
